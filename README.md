Check Your Understanding <br>
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because you want to automatically and iteratively test your software everytime new changes are pushed to the repository to make sure everything is working as intended (continuous integration).
2. No, we would not use an end to end test because it is meant to test user actions instead of unit testing where we would check if a function is returning the correct output.
3. I would not use a unit test for the message feature because it is not an individual component and interacts with many other components so that a user is able to send a message and another user is able to receive it.
4. I would use a unit test for the "max message length" feature because it is testing an individual part of my code that checks and prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
